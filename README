GServer is nice. It has a few features I found myself about to write from scratch.

Unfortunately, it only supports TCP, which is hardcoded all over the place. Unix domain sockets are nearly identical to TCP, but they are possibly slightly more efficient, and easier to secure on a local machine.

UNIXServer exists, but it barely adds anything beyond the raw socket interface.
